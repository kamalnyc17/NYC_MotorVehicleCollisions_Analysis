# NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions & Crashes Analysis
# Scope of the project:
## Our goal is to determine the effect of various traffic related changes in NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions during the past decade
### Some of the noteworthy changes in NYC since 2011 are:
#### The launch of Uber, Lyft and other rideshare programs in May, 2011.
#### Citi Bike was launched in May, 2013.
#### Green Cab (or Boro Taxi) was launched in the summer of 2013.
#### NYC speed limits were reduced from 30 mph to 25 mph in November, 2014.

## Being New Yorkers, we wanted to find out:
#### 1. How did the above changes impact NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions & Crashes?
#### 2. Were there significant differences in accident volume across the five city boroughs, given that each one has its own unique personality?
#### 3. What were the root causes of accidents? Was it primarily alcohol or were there other factors involved?
#### 4. Which vehicle type caused the most accidents? Was it Taxicabs, Buses or something else?
#### 5. Did seasonality have a significant role in NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions & Crashes?
