# DataAnalytics Project
# Scope of the Project
## Our goal is to determine the effect of various traffic related changes in NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions during the past decade
### Some of the noteworthy changes in NYC since 2011 are:-
#### Launch of Uber, Lyft and other ride share program in May 2011
#### Citibikes was launched in May 2013
#### NYC speed limits were reduced from 30 mph to 25 mph in November 2014

## Being New Yorkers, we wanted to find out:-
### 1. How all these changes impacted the NYC traffic situation in terms of Motor Vehicle Collisions & Crashes. 
### 2. Since, each borough of the city has their own unique personality, we wanted to explore if there are any significant difference in number of accidents across the boroughs.
### 3. What are the root causes of accident? is it just alcohol or there are other issues?
### 4. Are most of accidents caused by Taxicab, Bus or another vehicle type?
### 5. Does seasonality have any significant role in NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions & Crashes?
